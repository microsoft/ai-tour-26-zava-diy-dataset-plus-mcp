# Zava DIY Dataset Plus MCP

A comprehensive demonstration project featuring a realistic PostgreSQL dataset for **Zava DIY**, a fictional home improvement retail company, combined with three specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This project showcases advanced retail analytics, AI-powered product search capabilities, and secure multi-store data access patterns.

## Project Overview

This project provides:

- **üè™ Realistic Retail Dataset**: A complete PostgreSQL database with 50,000+ customers, 400+ products, 200,000+ transactions, and AI-ready vector embeddings
- **üîç Customer Sales MCP Servers**: Two intelligent product search servers - basic name-based search and advanced semantic search with AI
- **üìä Sales Analysis MCP Server**: Comprehensive sales database access for AI-powered analytics and insights
- **üîí Row Level Security**: Multi-tenant security ensuring store managers only access their store's data
- **üöÄ AI/ML Ready**: Vector embeddings for product similarity search and recommendation systems

The dataset simulates **Zava DIY**, a Washington State-based home improvement retailer with 8 locations (7 physical stores + online), complete with seasonal variations, realistic customer behavior patterns, and comprehensive product catalog covering tools, lumber, electrical, plumbing, and garden supplies.

## How to Use This Project

Fork this repository to get started with the Zava DIY dataset and MCP servers. The project is designed to be used in a development container for easy setup and includes scripts for deploying Azure resources if you want to integrate with Azure AI services. Then make it your own by customizing the dataset, MCP servers, or building new applications on top of the provided infrastructure..

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, new features, or bug fixes, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- **Docker Desktop** installed and running
- **Visual Studio Code** with the Dev Containers extension
- **Git** for cloning the repository

## Getting Started

### Opening the Project in a Dev Container

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gloveboxes/ai-tour-26-zava-diy-dataset-plus-mcp.git
   cd ai-tour-26-zava-diy-dataset-plus-mcp
   ```

   > **Note**: If you plan to use the data generation tools, uncomment `# -r data/requirements.txt` in the `requirements-dev.txt` file in the root folder of the repo before opening the dev container. This adds additional libraries required for data generation but will increase the dev container setup time.

2. **Open in VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. **Reopen in Container**:
   - When prompted by VS Code, click "Reopen in Container"
   - Or use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
   - Or click the green button in the bottom-left corner and select "Reopen in Container"

4. **Wait for Setup**:
   - The dev container will build automatically with all dependencies pre-installed
   - This includes PostgreSQL with pgvector extension, Python environment, and all required packages

The dev container provides a complete development environment with:
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
- Python 3.x with all required packages
- Azure CLI for cloud deployments

### Deploying Azure Resources (Optional)

If you want to use Azure AI services with this project, you can deploy the required Azure resources:

> **Note**: You'll need to be logged in to Azure CLI (`az login`) and have appropriate permissions to create resources in your subscription.

```bash
cd infra && ./deploy.sh
```

The deployment script will:
- Create an Azure AI Foundry workspace
- Deploy both **gpt-4o-mini** and **text-embedding-3-small** models
- Configure environment variables in `src/python/workshop/.env`

### Authenticating with Azure

If you plan to use the Azure AI models with this project, you'll need to authenticate with Azure first. Use the following command:

```bash
az login --use-device-code
```

This will display output similar to:
```
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code JGNL9Q4HW to authenticate.
```

Follow these steps:
1. Copy the device code (e.g., `JGNL9Q4HW`)
1. Open a web browser and navigate to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin
2. Paste the device code (e.g., `JGNL9Q4HW`)
3. Complete the authentication process in your browser
4. Return to your terminal to confirm successful authentication

Once authenticated, you can proceed use the Azure AI models in your applications and MCP servers.

### Key Components

- **üê≥ Dev Container**: Complete development environment with PostgreSQL, Python, and all dependencies
- **üîß MCP Servers**: Three specialized servers for product search (basic and semantic) and sales analysis
- **üóÑÔ∏è Database Generator**: Creates realistic retail data with seasonal patterns
- **üì± Web Applications**: Demo applications showcasing the dataset and MCP servers
- **üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure**: Azure deployment templates and configurations
- **üìö Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API documentation

## Zava Web Chat Client

This project includes a **Zava Web Chat Client** - a complete web application with HTML/CSS/JavaScript assets for building a basic web client interface. The web client provides a foundation for creating customer-facing chat applications that can integrate with the MCP servers for product search and sales assistance.

**Key Features**:

- **Web Application**: Pre-built Python web app for chat functionality (located in `src/python/web_app/`)
- **Frontend Assets**: Complete HTML/CSS/JavaScript components for web interface (located in `src/shared/static/`)
- **Integration Ready**: Designed to work with the project's MCP servers
- **Customizable**: Basic client that you can wire up and customize for your project

You'll need to wire up the web client to your specific project requirements and configure it to work with your chosen MCP servers and AI models.

## Getting Started with the Project

1. **Set up the dev container** (see instructions above)
2. **Generate the database** using the data generator
3. **Start the MCP servers** using VS Code tasks or directly
4. **Explore the dataset** using the provided sample queries
5. **Build applications** using the MCP servers for AI-powered retail experiences

This project serves as both a learning resource and a foundation for building sophisticated retail AI applications with realistic data patterns and secure multi-tenant access controls.
